# Note-Taking Methods

## What to Capture

Every meeting note should include at minimum:

1. **Decisions made** — What was decided, by whom, with what rationale
2. **Action items** — Who does what by when
3. **Key discussion points** — Not a transcript; the highlights that matter
4. **Open questions** — What wasn't resolved and needs follow-up

## Structured Meeting Notes Format

```markdown
# [Meeting Name] — [Date]

**Attendees:** [Names]
**Absent:** [Names]
**Duration:** [X minutes]

## Agenda
1. [Topic 1]
2. [Topic 2]

## Decisions
- **Decision:** [What was decided]
  - Context: [Why]
  - Alternatives considered: [What else was discussed]

## Action Items
- [ ] [Action] — @[Owner] — Due: [Date]
- [ ] [Action] — @[Owner] — Due: [Date]

## Discussion Notes
### [Topic 1]
- Key points discussed
- Different perspectives raised

### [Topic 2]
- Key points discussed

## Open Questions / Parking Lot
- [Question or topic for follow-up]

## Next Meeting
- **Date:** [Next meeting date]
- **Proposed topics:** [What should be on the next agenda]
```

## Decision Log

For important meetings, maintain a running decision log:

| Date | Decision | Context | Decided By | Status |
|------|----------|---------|------------|--------|
| | | | | Active / Superseded |

**Why:** Prevents "I thought we decided..." and "Why did we do it this way?" Questions answered forever.

## Action Item Best Practices

### The Three Requirements
Every action item needs:
1. **Owner** (one person, not "the team")
2. **Deliverable** (specific, concrete output)
3. **Deadline** (specific date, not "soon")

### Good vs. Bad Action Items
❌ "Team to look into the performance issue"
✅ "Sarah to profile the checkout API and share findings by Friday 2/21"

❌ "Follow up on the design"
✅ "Marcus to share updated wireframes in #design by Wednesday EOD"

### Tracking
- Review outstanding action items at the start of each meeting
- Items that carry over 3+ times need escalation or reprioritization
- Celebrate completions — positive reinforcement works

## Note-Taking Roles

### Dedicated Note-Taker
- One person captures, everyone else focuses on discussion
- Rotate the role to prevent one person always doing it
- Note-taker shares draft within 24 hours for corrections

### Collaborative Notes
- Shared document everyone can edit during the meeting
- Works well for brainstorms and working sessions
- Needs someone to organize/clean up after

### AI-Assisted Notes
- Transcription tools (Otter, Fireflies, etc.) capture everything
- Still need a human to extract decisions and action items
- Best used as backup, not replacement for structured notes

## After the Meeting

### Distribution Checklist
- [ ] Notes shared with all attendees (and relevant absent parties)
- [ ] Action items entered into tracking system
- [ ] Decisions documented in decision log
- [ ] Parking lot items assigned or scheduled
- [ ] Calendar invite for next meeting updated with prep/pre-reads
- [ ] Follow-up on any time-sensitive items same day
