# Facilitation Techniques

## Timeboxing
Set a fixed time for each agenda item. When time's up, decide: extend (by cutting something else) or move on.

**Why it works:** Prevents one topic from consuming the entire meeting. Creates urgency that focuses discussion.

**Implementation:**
- Assign times to each agenda item
- Visible timer (shared screen or physical)
- 2-minute warning before each timebox ends
- "We have 2 minutes left on this — do we need more time, or can we capture the action item and move on?"

## Round-Robin
Everyone speaks in turn. No interruptions.

**When to use:** When a few voices dominate, when you need everyone's input, during check-ins.

**Implementation:**
- "Let's go around the room. Everyone gets 2 minutes."
- Start with different people each time (don't always start with the most senior)
- It's okay to say "pass" — forced contribution isn't genuine contribution

## Silent Brainstorming
Everyone writes ideas independently before sharing.

**Why it works:** Prevents anchoring (where the first idea shared dominates). Gives introverts equal voice. Generates more diverse ideas.

**Implementation:**
1. State the question clearly
2. Everyone writes for 5-10 minutes (sticky notes, shared doc, or chat)
3. Share and cluster without judgment
4. Then discuss

## Parking Lot
Capture off-topic but valid points without derailing the current discussion.

**Implementation:**
- Visible list (whiteboard, shared doc, chat thread)
- "Great point — let me capture that in the parking lot so we don't lose it"
- Review parking lot at end of meeting or in follow-up
- Assign owners to parking lot items

## Fist of Five (Quick Consensus)
Quick visual check of agreement level.

**Scale:**
- 5 fingers: Strongly agree, fully support
- 4 fingers: Agree, support
- 3 fingers: Can live with it, won't block
- 2 fingers: Have concerns, need discussion
- 1 finger: Strongly disagree, will block

**Implementation:**
- "On three, show your fist of five for this decision"
- Address any 1s or 2s before moving forward
- Fast way to check alignment without lengthy discussion

## RACI for Decisions
Clarify who does what for each decision or action:
- **Responsible:** Does the work
- **Accountable:** Final decision maker (one person only)
- **Consulted:** Provides input before the decision
- **Informed:** Told after the decision

**Use when:** Roles are unclear, decisions keep getting revisited, accountability is fuzzy.

## The "What, So What, Now What" Framework
For processing information or events:
1. **What?** — What happened? (Facts only)
2. **So what?** — Why does it matter? What does it mean?
3. **Now what?** — What do we do about it?

**Use for:** Incident reviews, retrospectives, processing unexpected events.

## Dot Voting
Prioritize a list of items quickly and democratically.

**Implementation:**
1. List all items visibly
2. Each person gets 3-5 votes (dots/stickers)
3. Vote silently (no lobbying)
4. Count and rank
5. Discuss the top-voted items

## Managing Difficult Dynamics

### The Dominator
- "Thanks, [name]. Let's hear from others. [Quiet person], what's your take?"
- Use round-robin to ensure equal airtime
- Set a "one comment per person before seconds" rule

### The Silent Participant
- Use silent brainstorming (writing before speaking)
- Direct, warm invitation: "We haven't heard from you yet — any thoughts?"
- Follow up 1:1 — they may have input they're not comfortable sharing in the group
- Don't force it — some people contribute better in async follow-up

### The Tangent
- "Interesting — that's worth discussing. Let me add it to the parking lot."
- Gently redirect: "Let's come back to the decision at hand"
- Reference the agenda: "We have 10 minutes left for this item"

### The Conflict
- Acknowledge both perspectives
- Focus on interests, not positions: "What outcome are you both trying to achieve?"
- If heated: "Let's take 5 minutes to think, then come back to this"
- Take it offline if it's interpersonal, not topical
