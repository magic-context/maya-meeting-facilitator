# Follow-Up Best Practices

## The 24-Hour Rule
Meeting notes and action items should be distributed within 24 hours. After that, context fades and momentum dies.

**Ideal timeline:**
- Same day: Share notes with action items highlighted
- Next day: Confirm action items are in tracking system
- Before next meeting: Follow up on overdue items

## Action Item Accountability

### The Follow-Up Cadence
- **Due date arrives:** Check if it's done. If not, gentle ping.
- **1 day overdue:** Direct message to owner. "Hey, the X item was due yesterday — any blockers?"
- **3+ days overdue:** Escalate to meeting. "This has been open for [X]. Do we need to reassign or reprioritize?"
- **Recurring carry-over:** Address the pattern, not just the item. "This has carried over 3 weeks — is this still the right priority?"

### Making Follow-Up Work
- Track publicly — visible action items create social accountability
- Be specific about what "done" looks like
- If someone is consistently overdue, have a private conversation about capacity
- Don't nag — follow up once with genuine curiosity about blockers

## Meeting-Over-Meeting Continuity

### Recurring Meeting Hygiene
- Start with: review action items from last meeting
- End with: confirm new action items and owners
- Monthly: review the meeting itself — is it still valuable?
- Quarterly: consider restructuring, changing cadence, or canceling

### The Continuity Document
For recurring meetings, maintain a running document:
```
# [Meeting Name] — Running Notes

## Standing Agenda
1. Action item review (5 min)
2. [Topic] (X min)
3. Open discussion (X min)

## Action Items (Current)
- [ ] Item — @Owner — Due

## Recent Decisions
- [Date]: Decision about X

## Meeting History
### [Date]
- Key points
- Decisions
- New action items
```

## Escalation Framework

### When to Escalate
- Action item blocked by something outside the team's control
- Decision needs higher authority
- Repeated failure to complete items (capacity issue)
- Interpersonal conflict affecting meeting effectiveness

### How to Escalate
1. **Frame the issue** — specific, factual, no blame
2. **Show the impact** — what's at risk if this isn't resolved?
3. **Propose a solution** — come with options, not just problems
4. **Request specific help** — "I need you to [specific action]"

## Meeting Effectiveness Metrics

### Track Over Time
- **Action item completion rate** — % of items completed by deadline
- **Decision speed** — how quickly decisions get made vs. deferred
- **Meeting necessity** — how often meetings could have been async
- **Time investment** — total hours in meetings per week per person
- **Net Promoter Score** — periodically ask: "Was this meeting worth your time?"

### Signs of Healthy Meetings
- Action items get done on time (>80%)
- Decisions are made, not deferred
- People show up prepared
- Everyone contributes
- Meetings end on time or early
- People leave knowing what to do next

### Signs of Unhealthy Meetings
- Same action items carry over week after week
- Decisions get revisited repeatedly
- One or two people dominate
- People multitask (camera off, typing)
- Meetings consistently run over
- "What was this meeting about again?"

## Async Alternatives

Not everything needs a meeting. Consider:

| Instead of Meeting | Try This |
|-------------------|----------|
| Status update | Written update (email, Slack, dashboard) |
| Information sharing | Recorded video (Loom) or document |
| Simple decision | Proposal with async vote |
| Document feedback | Comments in the document |
| Quick question | Direct message or thread |
| Brainstorm with few people | Shared doc with async contributions |
