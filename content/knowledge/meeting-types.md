# Meeting Types

## Standup / Daily Sync
**Purpose:** Quick alignment, surface blockers
**Duration:** 15 minutes max
**Format:** Each person answers: What did I do? What will I do? Any blockers?
**Tips:**
- Stand up (literally) — it keeps it short
- Don't solve problems here — take them offline
- Same time every day, no exceptions
- If everyone says "same as yesterday," you might not need this meeting

## 1:1 Meetings
**Purpose:** Relationship building, coaching, career development, alignment
**Duration:** 25-50 minutes
**Frequency:** Weekly or biweekly
**Format:**
- Their agenda first — what do they want to discuss?
- Your topics second
- Always make time for career/growth discussion
**Tips:**
- Never cancel. Reschedule if needed, but 1:1s are sacred.
- This is THEIR meeting, not a status update for you
- Take notes — follow up on what they share
- Ask: "How can I help you?" and mean it

## Decision Meeting
**Purpose:** Make a specific decision
**Duration:** 25-50 minutes
**Format:**
1. Frame the decision (2 min)
2. Present options with tradeoffs (10 min)
3. Discussion (15-20 min)
4. Decision and rationale (5 min)
5. Action items and communication plan (5 min)
**Tips:**
- Pre-read is mandatory — don't present information that should have been read before
- Be explicit: "We need to decide X by the end of this meeting"
- Document the decision AND the alternatives considered
- Disagree and commit — once decided, everyone aligns

## Brainstorm / Ideation
**Purpose:** Generate ideas, explore possibilities
**Duration:** 50-90 minutes
**Format:**
1. Frame the problem (5 min)
2. Silent ideation (10 min — everyone writes ideas independently)
3. Share and cluster (15-20 min)
4. Discuss and prioritize (20-30 min)
5. Next steps (5 min)
**Tips:**
- Separate generation from evaluation — no "yes, but" during ideation
- Silent writing first prevents anchoring to the first idea shared
- Diverse perspectives improve outcomes — invite people from different functions
- Energy and psychological safety matter more than process

## Sprint Planning
**Purpose:** Align on what the team will deliver this sprint
**Duration:** 1-2 hours
**Format:**
1. Review sprint goal and priorities (10 min)
2. Walk through candidates from backlog (30-40 min)
3. Estimate and commit (20-30 min)
4. Identify dependencies and risks (10 min)
5. Confirm sprint goal (5 min)
**Tips:**
- Product owner defines WHAT, team defines HOW MUCH
- Don't overcommit — underpromise, overdeliver
- Raise concerns early — "I don't think we can finish this in one sprint"
- Leave capacity buffer (15-20%) for unexpected work

## Retrospective
**Purpose:** Continuous improvement — what worked, what didn't, what to change
**Duration:** 50-90 minutes
**Frequency:** End of each sprint/cycle
**Format:** (Many options — vary to keep it fresh)
- **Start/Stop/Continue** — What should we start, stop, and keep doing?
- **Mad/Sad/Glad** — Emotional temperature of the sprint
- **4Ls** — Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for
- **Sailboat** — Wind (what pushed us forward), Anchors (what held us back), Rocks (risks ahead)
**Tips:**
- Psychological safety is everything — if people don't feel safe, they won't be honest
- Pick 1-2 action items maximum — more than that won't get done
- Follow up on last retro's action items first
- Rotate facilitators to get different perspectives

## Status Update / Review
**Purpose:** Share progress, align stakeholders
**Duration:** 25-50 minutes
**Format:**
1. Progress against goals (10-15 min)
2. Key decisions made (5 min)
3. Blockers and risks (10 min)
4. Next steps (5 min)
5. Q&A (5-10 min)
**Tips:**
- Consider: could this be a written update instead?
- Present outcomes, not activities ("We shipped X" not "We worked on X")
- Highlight decisions that need escalation
- Keep stakeholders focused on what they need to know, not everything that happened
