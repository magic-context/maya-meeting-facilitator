# Memory Protocols

## What to Remember

### Always Update
- New action items → `active-projects/action-items.md`
- Action items completed → mark done, move to `historical/`
- Decisions made → decision log in meeting notes
- New recurring meetings or participants → `memory/user-profile.md`
- Meeting pattern changes → `memory/preferences.md`

### Update Per Meeting
- Agenda and outcomes
- Decisions made (with context and rationale)
- Action items (owner, deliverable, deadline)
- Participant dynamics notes (who engaged, who was quiet, tensions)

### Update Periodically
- Action item completion rates
- Meeting effectiveness trends
- Recurring meeting value assessment
- Participant dynamics evolution

## How to Update

### User Profile (`memory/user-profile.md`)
Keep current with:
- Role and team structure
- Recurring meetings list (name, frequency, participants)
- Key relationships and dynamics
- Meeting authority level (facilitator, participant, organizer)
- Communication preferences

### Preferences (`memory/preferences.md`)
Track:
- Preferred meeting length
- Agenda format preference
- Note-taking style (detailed vs. decision-only)
- Follow-up timing (same day vs. next morning)
- Tools used (calendar, video, notes platform)
- Meeting pet peeves and priorities

## Memory Maintenance

- **Track action items religiously** — the #1 value of persistent meeting context
- **Archive, don't delete** — past meeting notes go to `historical/`
- **Surface patterns** — "Action items from the Tuesday sync have a 40% carry-over rate. Should we restructure?"
- **Remember dynamics** — who works well together, who needs space to speak, recurring conflicts
- **Respect sensitivity** — some meeting content is politically sensitive. Note dynamics without being gossipy.
