# Maya — Your AI Meeting Facilitator That Never Drops the Ball

Every meeting tool captures notes. Maya manages **your meetings** — she remembers every action item, every decision, every participant dynamic, and which recurring meetings are actually worth keeping. She makes meetings produce outcomes because she never forgets the follow-through.

## The Problem

You leave a meeting with five action items. By next week, two are forgotten, one was vaguely assigned to "the team," and nobody remembers what was actually decided. You ask an AI to help plan your next meeting — it has no idea what happened in the last one, who the participants are, or that the same action item has been deferred three weeks running.

**Maya fixes this.**

## What Maya Does

📋 **Smart Agendas** — Built from context: outstanding action items, previous decisions, upcoming deadlines, and participant dynamics

📝 **Structured Notes** — Decisions, action items, and key points captured consistently. Never "what did we decide again?"

✅ **Action Item Tracking** — Owner, deliverable, deadline. Tracked across meetings. Overdue items get flagged.

🔄 **Meeting Continuity** — Every recurring meeting builds on the last. No re-explaining, no lost context.

🎯 **Facilitation Guidance** — The right technique for the right meeting: timeboxing, round-robin, silent brainstorm, dot voting

📊 **Meeting Health** — Track completion rates, identify carry-over patterns, and audit which meetings are worth keeping

## How It Works

Maya is an **AI Specialist** built on [Magic Context](https://magiccontext.ai). Instead of starting every AI conversation from scratch, Maya maintains a persistent workspace — your meeting landscape, participant dynamics, action item history, and decision logs — that carries across every session.

### The Magic Context Difference

Traditional AI is **stateless** — it forgets everything between conversations. Magic Context gives AI specialists **persistent memory** through structured workspaces. This means:

- **Session 1:** Maya learns your meeting landscape, recurring cadences, and pain points
- **Session 5:** Maya flags that the same action item has carried over three weeks and suggests escalation
- **Session 20:** Maya knows your participant dynamics — who dominates, who needs space to speak, who follows through
- **Session 50+:** Maya has a complete decision log and action item history that makes your meetings compound in value

**Your context is yours.** It's stored as plain markdown files you can read, edit, or export anytime. No black box. No vendor lock-in.

## Quick Start

### Import to AI Specialists Hub

```bash
# Via the Magic Context import feature
import_specialist github.com/magic-context/maya-meeting-facilitator
```

Or use the import tool in [AI Specialists Hub](https://aispecialistshub.com) with:
```
https://github.com/magic-context/maya-meeting-facilitator
```

### First Session

Maya will learn your meeting landscape:
1. Your role and what meetings you run/attend
2. Recurring meetings and their cadences
3. Key participants and dynamics
4. Tools you use
5. Meeting pain points and goals

Then she'll help optimize your next meeting.

### Ongoing Use

- **Before meetings:** Build agendas with context from previous sessions
- **During meetings:** Capture notes, decisions, and action items
- **After meetings:** Distribute notes, track action items
- **Weekly:** Review outstanding items, prep for upcoming meetings
- **Periodically:** Audit meeting health and optimize cadences
